# Tumblr likes downloader

Node.js script to download your tumblr likes!

Uses puppeteer to crawl your Tumblr likes (No API limits!) and extracts the assets url from the pages, to automatically download them.
Clone the script, run `npm install`, change the login information in `tumblr-crawler.js` and finally run the script with `node tumbr-crawler`.

(Only tested on macOS, feel free to update it for windows and send me a pull request)

You're welcome!
